## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.12 or higher, can easly managed by `uv`
2. [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
3. Trello account and API credentials
4. [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager installed

## Pre-installation
1. Make sure you have installed Claude Desktop App
2. Make sure you have already logged in with your account into Claude.
3. Start Claude

## Installation



1. Set up Trello API credentials:
   - Go to [Trello Apps Administration](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)
   - Create a new integration at [New Power-Up or Integration](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin/new)
   - Fill in your information (you can leave the Iframe connector URL empty) and make sure to select the correct Workspace
   - Click your app's icon and navigate to "API key" from left sidebar. 
   - Copy your "API key" and on the right side: "you can manually generate a Token." click the word token to get your Trello Token.

2. Rename the `.env.example` file in the project root with `.env` and set vairables you just got:
```bash
TRELLO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
TRELLO_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

3. Install uv if you haven't already:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

4. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/m0xai/trello-mcp-server.git
cd trello-mcp-server
```

5. Install dependencies and set server for Claude using uv::
```bash
uv run mcp install main.py
```

6. Restart Claude Desktop app

## Server Modes

This MCP server can run in two different modes:

### Claude App Mode

This mode integrates directly with the Claude Desktop application:

1. Set `USE_CLAUDE_APP=true` in your `.env` file (this is the default)
2. Run the server with:
```bash
uv run mcp install main.py
```
3. Restart the Claude Desktop application

### SSE Server Mode

This mode runs as a standalone SSE server that can be used with any MCP-compatible client, including Cursor:

1. Set `USE_CLAUDE_APP=false` in your `.env` file
2. Run the server with:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. The server will be available at `http://localhost:8952` by default (or your configured port)

### Docker Mode

You can also run the server using Docker Compose:

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Create your `.env` file with your configuration
3. Build and start the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
4. The server will run in SSE mode by default
5. To view logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
6. To stop the server:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

#### Pulling the Docker Image (Alternative to Building)

- A pre-built image is available at Docker Hub and is updated automatically by CI:

```bash
docker pull valerok86/trello-mcp-server:latest
```

Then run it with your `.env` file mounted:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8952:8952 valerok86/trello-mcp-server:latest
```

##### How to Prepare Your `.env` File

1. **Get the Example File:**
   - In the root of this repository, you will find a file named `.env.example`.
   - Download or copy this file to your working directory and rename it to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

2. **Edit the `.env` File:**
   - Open `.env` in your favorite text editor.
   - Fill in the required values. At minimum, you need:
     ```env
     TRELLO_API_KEY=your_trello_api_key_here
     TRELLO_TOKEN=your_trello_token_here
     USE_CLAUDE_APP=false
     MCP_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
     MCP_SERVER_PORT=8952
     ```
   - You can get your Trello API key and token by following the instructions in the "Installation" section above.
   - **Tip:** Never commit your `.env` file to a public repository, as it contains sensitive credentials.

3. **Where to Place the `.env` File:**
   - Place the `.env` file in the same directory where you run your `docker run` command.
   - Example directory structure:
     ```
     /your/project/
       ├── .env
       └── (other files)
     ```

4. **Full Example Workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository (optional, for getting the .env.example file)
   git clone https://github.com/m0xai/trello-mcp-server.git
   cd trello-mcp-server

   # Copy and edit the .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   # (edit .env with your credentials)

   # Pull and run the Docker image
   docker pull valerok86/trello-mcp-server:latest
   docker run --env-file .env -p 8952:8952 valerok86/trello-mcp-server:latest
   ```

This allows you to get started quickly without building the image locally.

## Configuration

The server can be configured using environment variables in the `.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| TRELLO_API_KEY | Your Trello API key | Required |
| TRELLO_TOKEN | Your Trello API token | Required |
| MCP_SERVER_NAME | The name of the MCP server | Trello MCP Server |
| MCP_SERVER_HOST | Host address for SSE mode | 0.0.0.0 |
| MCP_SERVER_PORT | Port for SSE mode | 8952 |
| USE_CLAUDE_APP | Whether to use Claude app mode | true |

You can customize the server by editing these values in your `.env` file.

## Trello API Rate Limiting

This server automatically handles Trello API rate limits as described in the [official Trello documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/rate-limits/):

- Trello enforces a limit of 300 requests per 10 seconds per API key, and 100 requests per 10 seconds per token.
- If a rate limit is exceeded, Trello returns a 429 error and may include a `Retry-After` header.
- The MCP server's Trello API client will automatically detect 429 errors, wait for the appropriate time (using the `Retry-After` header if present, otherwise using exponential backoff), and retry the request up to 5 times.
- This ensures your requests are less likely to fail due to rate limiting, and you do not need to implement this logic yourself.

**Reference:** [Trello API Rate Limits](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/rate-limits/)

## Client Integration

### Using with Claude Desktop

1. Run the server in Claude app mode (`USE_CLAUDE_APP=true`)
2. Start or restart Claude Desktop
3. Claude will automatically detect and connect to your MCP server

### Using with Cursor

To connect your MCP server to Cursor:

1. Run the server in SSE mode (`USE_CLAUDE_APP=false`)
2. In Cursor, go to Settings (gear icon) > AI > Model Context Protocol
3. Add a new server with URL `http://localhost:8952` (or your configured host/port), alternative to use dokcer 127.0.0.1 (not exposed to the outside work) and in the scp configuraiton use "url": `http://host.docker.internal:8952/sse`
4. Select the server when using Cursor's AI features

You can also add this configuration to your Cursor settings JSON file (typically at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trello-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "TRELLO_API_KEY",
        "-e",
        "TRELLO_TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "USE_CLAUDE_APP",
        "-e",
        "MCP_SERVER_HOST",
        "-e",
        "MCP_SERVER_PORT",
        "-e",
        "MCP_SERVER_NAME",
        "-p",
        "8952:8952",
        "valerok86/trello-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "TRELLO_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "TRELLO_TOKEN": "your_token",
        "USE_CLAUDE_APP": "false",
        "MCP_SERVER_HOST": "0.0.0.0",
        "MCP_SERVER_PORT": "8952",
        "MCP_SERVER_NAME": "Trello MCP Server"
      },
      "url": "http://localhost:8952/sse"
  }
}
```

### Automatic Trello Authorization URL

If the server encounters a 401 Unauthorized error when communicating with the Trello API, it will automatically log a URL that you can visit to authorize the app for your Trello account. This URL is generated using your API key from the `.env` file and looks like this:

```
https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=never&name=Trello+Assistant+MCP&scope=read,write&response_type=token&key=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

**How to use:**
1. Copy the URL from the server logs when prompted.
2. Open it in your browser and approve the app.
3. Copy the generated token and update your `.env` file as `TRELLO_TOKEN=your_new_token`.
4. Restart the server to apply the new token.

This makes it easy to authorize the app for any Trello user without manual URL construction.

### Using with Other MCP Clients

For other MCP-compatible clients, point them to the SSE endpoint at `http://localhost:8952`.

### Minimal Client Example

Here's a minimal Python example to connect to the SSE endpoint:

```python
import asyncio
import httpx

async def connect_to_mcp_server():
    url = "http://localhost:8952/sse"
    headers = {"Accept": "text/event-stream"}
    
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        async with client.stream("GET", url, headers=headers) as response:
            # Get the session ID from the first SSE message
            session_id = None
            async for line in response.aiter_lines():
                if line.startswith("data:"):
                    data = line[5:].strip()
                    if "session_id=" in data and not session_id:
                        session_id = data.split("session_id=")[1]
                        
                        # Send a message using the session ID
                        message_url = f"http://localhost:8952/messages/?session_id={session_id}"
                        message = {
                            "role": "user",
                            "content": {
                                "type": "text",
                                "text": "Show me my Trello boards"
                            }
                        }
                        await client.post(message_url, json=message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(connect_to_mcp_server())
```

### Overriding .env Configurations with Docker

You can override any configuration from your `.env` file by passing environment variables directly to the container using the `-e` flag with `docker run`. In fact, you can provide all configuration parameters this way, making the `.env` file optional. For example:

```sh
docker run \
  -e TRELLO_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  -e TRELLO_TOKEN=your_token \
  -e USE_CLAUDE_APP=false \
  -e MCP_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e MCP_SERVER_PORT=8952 \
  -e MCP_SERVER_NAME="Trello MCP Server" \
  -p 8952:8952 \
  valerok86/trello-mcp-server:latest
```

Environment variables passed with `-e` will take precedence over those defined in your `.env` file. This allows you to easily change configuration at runtime without modifying your `.env` file, or to run the container without a `.env` file at all.

### Running with Docker Run (Alternative to Docker Compose)

You can run the container directly using `docker run` instead of Docker Compose. Here's the simplified command that relies on defaults from the Dockerfile:

```sh
docker run \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p "${MCP_SERVER_PORT:-8952}:${MCP_SERVER_PORT:-8952}" \
  -v "$(pwd):/app" \
  --env-file .env \
  valerok86/trello-mcp-server:latest
```

This command:
- Uses the same restart policy as Docker Compose
- Maps the same port (defaulting to 8952 if not specified)
- Mounts the current directory to `/app` in the container
- Loads environment variables from `.env`

The following settings are now handled by the Dockerfile:
- Python unbuffered output (PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1)
- SSE mode (USE_CLAUDE_APP=false)
- Server name (MCP_SERVER_NAME)
- Server host (MCP_SERVER_HOST)
- Default port (MCP_SERVER_PORT)

You can still override any of these settings using the `-e` flag if needed.
